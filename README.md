# Installing QT

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

First you need to download QT 5:  
```
https://www.qt.io/
```
In the upper right hand corner there is a button that says download
click on it and navigate to the open source option. Accept the terms of service. 
Again scroll down and hit download

After the installer is downloaded, open it up.

For linux:
```
chmod +x (qt install file)
./(qt install file)
```

For windows it should just be an .exe file.

When it opens up create a qt profile for yourself.

When you get to the installation screen select QT 5.10.0. 

On linux this will around 3-4 GB, however Mac and Windows require around 30+ GB.
